# Noughts and Crosses

Noughts and crosses is a tic-tac-toe style game that allows a user to play against the computer to try and score three counters in a row. The user plays as an X and the compuer plays as an O. Once the game end, the score card displays if the user wins, loses, or if the game ends in a draw. 

The user can then reset the game and start again to obtain a better score, thus keeping them engaged.
